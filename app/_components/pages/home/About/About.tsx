          Hey, I’m Shehroze! I’m a <strong>Full Stack Engineer</strong> based in
          Germany.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I specialize in crafting secure, scalable, and downright fast{" "}
          <strong>web applications</strong> in fast-paced{" "}
          <strong>startup</strong> environments. My journey from eager beginner
          to leading engineering teams has been fueled by a mix of{" "}
          <strong>grit</strong>, <strong>curiosity</strong>, and an{" "}
          <strong>obsession</strong> with delivering top-notch results. I thrive
          on tackling complex challenges, driving innovation, and turning
          ambitious ideas into reality.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When I’m not deep in code, you’ll find me experimenting with
          recipes😋, exploring the mysteries of the universe🌍, or getting lost
          in my favorite playlists🎧. Let’s <strong>connect</strong> and build
          something extraordinary together! 🚀
